How it Works:
Input Video: Specify the video file (video_path) you want to process.
Output Directory: The directory where the frames will be saved.
Frame Rate: The number of frames per second to extract. For example, 1 extracts one frame every second.
Output Format: Choose the desired image format (e.g., jpg, png).
Prerequisites:
Install ffmpeg on your system and ensure it's available in your system's PATH. You can check by running ffmpeg -version in your terminal or command prompt.
Install R and optionally the fs package for directory handling.
You can customize the `frame_rate` and `output_format` parameters based on your requirements.
